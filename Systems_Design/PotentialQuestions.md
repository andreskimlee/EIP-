     Why production engineering

    I consider myself a curious learner and particularly in regards to production engineering i am vastly curious how facebook is able to operate 
    at such a large scale. I believe overcoming that massive wall that means this job to me is a once in a lifetime learning opportunity both in technical and personal aspects.

    Why facebook:
    I largely am looking for a company that will fostering a learning and creative environment. The fact that cutting edge technologies such as graphql, react, have been born in the home of facebook to me speaks volumes in terms of the work environment there.I think facebook fosters Creative problem solving and truly pushing the envelope of whats possible an working with and creating cutting edge modern technologies is what motivates me to work at facebook. 

    biggest Challenges: 

    My biggest technical challenge to date and its still an ongoing process -> Learned to continuously learning and improving my skills.
